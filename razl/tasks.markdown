## Task List

The Task List displays a list of actions you would like Razl to perform, you can queue up and review tasks in the task list before executing them all or selecting a single task and executing it.

As tasks are executed they are removed from the Task List.

### Available Tasks

Razl supports the following list of tasks:

| Copy All | Copy all items and itâ€™s children from the source instance to the target instance. Copy all has a merge and overwrite option. Merge will merge existing items and create new items, it does not delete any additional items from the target instance. Overwrite will do the same as merge but also delete any items that exist on the target machine but not on the source machine. Any missing parent items will also be copied. | 
| Copy Item | Copy a single item from the source instance to the target instance. Any missing parents will also be copied. | 
| Copy Version | Copy a specific item version from the source instance to the target instance. | 
| Delete Item | Removes the item from the specified instance. | 
| Move Item | Moves the item in the content tree on the target instance to the same location on the source instance. It will also merge any field differences. Any missing parents will also be copied. |
| Set Field Value | Copy the specified field value from the source instance to the target instance. | 
| Set Property Value | Copy the specified item property from the source instance to the target instance. | 

### Copy All and Lightning Mode

When you have added a copy all task to the task list, you may run the task in normal mode or lightning mode. In normal mode, all items are copied even if they are the same. In Lightning Mode, the Revision Id for both sides is compared and if it matches, the item is skipped. This makes lightning mode much quicker when there are only a few scattered differences between the two Sitecore trees.

### Removing Tasks

Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking the red cross next to a task:

##Exporting Tasks
Razl supports exporting the task list as a Razl Script. This is done by clicking the Export Tasks button at the 
bottom of the Razl form. The exported .xml task list can be executed using the [razl script](http://hedgehogdevelopment.github.io/razl/script.html) mechanism.
