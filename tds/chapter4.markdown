# Team Development for Sitecore 

## Chapter 4 â€“ Using TDS for Sitecore Development

Hedgehog Development originally developed TDS as an internal project to help our own development teams build Sitecore implementations. TDS was developed for Sitecore developers, by Sitecore developers. The guidelines documented in this manual are the best practices we have built around using TDS as a development platform for many Sitecore implementations. We recognize that not all development projects are organized the same way, and TDS was designed to allow as many different ways of developing Sitecore sites as possible.

The primary goal of TDS was to allow developers to manage their Sitecore schema (Templates, Layouts, Sublayouts, Taxonomy and meta-data items) the same way they manage source code. The Software development field has, over the years, built many exceptional tools and practices for managing and deploying source code, but Sitecore developers were not able to leverage things like Source Control, automated builds and automated deployments for their Sitecore items.
