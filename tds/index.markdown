# Team Development for Sitecore 

## About TDS

TDS (Team Development for Sitecore), a Microsoft Visual Studio Plugin, brings Sitecore items into Visual Studio while reducing developerâ€™s deployment time to almost zero.  
By using TDS, developers can improve control and overall team performance by integrating Source Code Control into Sitecore and Visual Studio projects.  
TDS allows new developers to be easily added to a project. New developers can get the most recent updates from the Source Code Control and begin making 
updates to the project almost immediately.  TDS eliminates the need for manually tracking item changes for deployment, since all changes are automatically 
tracked by source control.  TDS features continuous builds and fully automated deployment releases.  TDS allows Sitecore items to be moved in and out of a 
Sitecore instance within Microsoft Visual Studio.  TDS helps keep track of changes by allowing the developer to quickly compare their project items to their developer 
instance of Sitecore.  Because of all this, TDS significantly increases the ability for developers to work in teams, and saves time, money, and a good deal of 
frustration in the long run.
