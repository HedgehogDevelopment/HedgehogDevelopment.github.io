## About Sitecore Feydra
When creating a Sitecore web application, there are many dependencies between the tasks of 
front-end and back-end developers. Sitecore Feydra tries to break these dependencies by allowing 
front-end developers to work on the Sitecore web application without needing to install 
and maintain an entire Sitecore development environment.
