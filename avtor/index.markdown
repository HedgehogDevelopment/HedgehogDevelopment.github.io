## About Avtor
Avtor adds a new dimension to editing content on Sitecore websites. Before Avtor, making changes to multiple Sitecore items could take many steps. Avtor allows the content editor to choose the fields they are interested in editing and presents them with a view of those fields across all Sitecore items in the content tree. This allows the content editor to quickly review and update those fields.
