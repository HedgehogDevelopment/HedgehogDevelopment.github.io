# Item Buckets in Avtor
Avtor is designed to make working with content in Item Buckets as easy as other types of content. Avtor has a simple search mechanism for locating items in the bucket and when items are found, they are added to the content tree and editable fields are provided for the user.

## Finding items in an Item Bucket
When working with items in an Item Bucket, the user is presented with a search box when the item bucket is opened.

**Please Note:** This search box will only show up if the "View Buckets" check box in the content editor is disabled. This shouldn't be a problem in most cases since this is only available to administrators.

Entering a value into the item bucket causes Avtor to add any content items containing the value entered into the content tree and editing area.

The content editor can update these items the same way they would update any other items in the content tree.

Performing an additional search will add any newly found items to the list of items shown to the content editor for editing.

Pressing the Clear Results button will remove any Items located by the user from the result list under the bucket.

## Creating a Field Set for an item in a bucket
Item in the item buckets may contain fields that are not available in other item in the content tree. To create a field set for these items, search for an item and then right-click on the item and select "Add Field Set". This procedure is the same as [creating a field set](/avtor/fieldsets.html#creating-a-field-set) for any other item.

## Using Avtor search and Item Buckets
The Avtor search ribbon will search for items in the item bucket. When the bucket is expanded, the bucket will find and highlight the items matching your search criteria.

If the Item Bucket is showing results, the items containing content found by Avtor Search will automatically be highlighted in the bucket results.
